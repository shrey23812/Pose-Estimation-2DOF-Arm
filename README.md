# Pose-Estimation-2DOF-Arm
Convolutional Neural Network for estimation of pose i.e angles and position of 2 Degree of Freedom arm from images.

Download the Repository and than chose the way in which you want to train your network i.e. using angles or the coordinates of end effector.
Generate the images using the draw_2dof_arm.py program.
After that just run the python file named train.py, if you have run once and you have a model.h5 file it wont train again.

Libraries needed: tensorflow,Keras,numpy,opencv,matplotlib,pygame

P.S.
This is a very simple program for pose estimation and thus I'll not recommend to use it for commercial purposes but if you do and something goes wrong I am not responsible :P
