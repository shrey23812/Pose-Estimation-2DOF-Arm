# Pose-Estimation-2DOF-Arm
Convolutional Neural Network for estimation of pose i.e angles and position of 2 Degree of Freedom arm from images.

This is a very simple program for pose estimation and thus I'll not recommend to use it for commercial purposes but if you do and something goes wrong I am not responsible :P

Download the Repository and than chose the way in which you want to train your network i.e. using angles or the coordinates of end effector.
After going in to the folder just run the python file named train.py if you have run once and you have a model.h5 file it wont train again.

Libraries needed: tensorflow,Keras,numpy,opencv,matplotlib

You can find the training images in the folders inisde the folders.

You can change training data by changing code inside the train file.
